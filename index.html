    <h1>Welcome to Introduction on JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    <p class="para1"><strong>programming language</strong> is a broad term that refers to a variety of different ways to instruct a computer. In a strict sense, a programming language is a set of syntactic and semantic rules that describe a formal language and must be able to express the steps that a machine must perform to convert some input to an output.
    <p>Before the computer can perform those steps, though, the program needs to be converted to a form the computer can understand. Programs called compilers and interpreters perform this conversion. At their most basic level, <strong>compilers and interpreters</strong> are similar: they both translate a program written in a specific programming language to something that the computer can execute, typically referred to as "1s and 0s" since all information on digital computers gets stored as 1s and 0</p>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Compilers  and interpreters</strong> differ primarily in what they do with those 1s and 0s. <strong>Compilers</strong> produce an output file that the computer can run directly, perhaps after some additional processing called linking.<br> <strong>Interpreters</strong>, however, don't produce 1s and 0s that the computer can run directly - instead, the interpreter runs the interpreted code directly, or perhaps passes it on to a companion program.</p>
    <p>JavaScript, at its heart, is an interpreted language. However, for performance reasons, most modern JavaScript engines employ a special kind of compiler called a <strong>Just In Time (JIT)</strong> compiler that takes the interpreted code one step further and lets the computer run the resul</p>
   <h2>Stylish JavaScript</h2>
   <p>The JavaScript community has established some stylistic guidelines to assist in making JavaScript code easier to read and write.<br>Not all of the guidelines agree on everything, but there is plenty of overlap. Even if you disagree with every convention, adhering to the style conventions of a programming language is beneficial and meaningful.</p>
    <p>
      Here's a short list of guidelines that we recommend. If you already work with a formal set of guidelines, please feel free to use them. If you don't, our suggestions should help you write readable code.
      <ul>
        <li>Set your <strong>text editor</strong> to use space characters—not tabs—for indentation. The editor should also insert spaces if you press the <strong>"tab"</strong> key on your keyboard.</li>
        <li>Set your text editor to use <strong>2 spaces</strong> for indentation and when converting tab characters to spaces.</li>
        <li>Try to limit lines to <strong>80 characters</strong>. This limit isn't a universal preference, but it helps readability. Not all developers have massive screens or good eyesight.</li>
        <li>JavaScript uses the character sequence <strong>{ // }</strong> to mark the beginning of a comment. Such comments run through the end of the line.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Programmers use <strong>comments to leave notes</strong> for other programmers or themselves at a later point in time; however, don't overdo your comments. Let your code do the talking instead.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When writing a code block or function body with curly braces, write the opening brace on the same line as the function name or conditional expression.Use a single space just before the opening brace.
        </li>
        <li>Use spaces between operators and operands to make your code less cluttered and easier to read:<br>
          let sum=x+5;              // bad<br>
          let sum = x + 5;          // good</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
