    <h1>Welcome: Introduction on JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    <p class="para1"><strong>programming language</strong> is a broad term that refers to a variety of different ways to instruct a computer. In a strict sense, a programming language is a set of syntactic and semantic rules that describe a formal language and must be able to express the steps that a machine must perform to convert some input to an output.
    <p>Before the computer can perform those steps, though, the program needs to be converted to a form the computer can understand. Programs called compilers and interpreters perform this conversion. At their most basic level, <strong>compilers and interpreters</strong> are similar: they both translate a program written in a specific programming language to something that the computer can execute, typically referred to as "1s and 0s" since all information on digital computers gets stored as 1s and 0</p>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Compilers  and interpreters</strong> differ primarily in what they do with those 1s and 0s. <strong>Compilers</strong> produce an output file that the computer can run directly, perhaps after some additional processing called linking.<br> <strong>Interpreters</strong>, however, don't produce 1s and 0s that the computer can run directly - instead, the interpreter runs the interpreted code directly, or perhaps passes it on to a companion program.</p>
    <p>JavaScript, at its heart, is an interpreted language. However, for performance reasons, most modern JavaScript engines employ a special kind of compiler called a <strong>Just In Time (JIT)</strong> compiler that takes the interpreted code one step further and lets the computer run the resul</p>
   <h2>Stylish JavaScript</h2>
   <p>The JavaScript community has established some stylistic guidelines to assist in making JavaScript code easier to read and write.<br>Not all of the guidelines agree on everything, but there is plenty of overlap. Even if you disagree with every convention, adhering to the style conventions of a programming language is beneficial and meaningful.</p>
    <p>
      Here's a short list of guidelines that we recommend. If you already work with a formal set of guidelines, please feel free to use them. If you don't, our suggestions should help you write readable code.
      <ul>
        <li>Set your <strong>text editor</strong> to use space characters—not tabs—for indentation. The editor should also insert spaces if you press the <strong>"tab"</strong> key on your keyboard.</li>
        <li>Set your text editor to use <strong>2 spaces</strong> for indentation and when converting tab characters to spaces.</li>
        <li>Try to limit lines to <strong>80 characters</strong>. This limit isn't a universal preference, but it helps readability. Not all developers have massive screens or good eyesight.</li>
        <li>JavaScript uses the character sequence <strong>{ // }</strong> to mark the beginning of a comment. Such comments run through the end of the line.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Programmers use <strong>comments to leave notes</strong> for other programmers or themselves at a later point in time; however, don't overdo your comments. Let your code do the talking instead.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When writing a code block or function body with curly braces, write the opening brace on the same line as the function name or conditional expression.Use a single space just before the opening brace.
        </li>
        <li>Use spaces between operators and operands to make your code less cluttered and easier to read:<br>
          let sum=x+5;              // bad<br>
          let sum = x + 5;          // good</li>
          <li>Use semicolons to terminate each logical line of code unless the line ends with {, }, or :</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That covers the essential style conventions that you need to get started. If you want more information about JavaScript styling, we recommend<a style="color: red;" href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript"> Airbnb's JavaScript style guide</a>. Check it out, but don't try to memorize all of the rules right away.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
    <p>Although <strong>naming conventions</strong> are similar to<strong> style conventions</strong> (and are frequently discussed together), JavaScript naming conventions have more gray areas and complexity than most languages, so we'll discuss them separately.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use <strong>camelCase formatting</strong> for most variable and function names. Such names begin with a lowercase letter. If the name contains multiple words, each subsequent word should begin with an uppercase letter:<br>

        let <strong>answerToUltimateQuestion</strong> = 42;      // initializing a variable<br>
        function <strong>fourScoreAndSevenYearsAgo</strong> ()   { // defining a function

          // do something
        }</li>
        <li>Some function names -- constructor functions -- should normally use <strong>PascalCase</strong> (also known as CamelCase -- with a capital C) names. For instance:
        
          function <strong>DomesticCat(name)</strong> {           // defining a function<br>
            // do something
          }
        </li>
        <li>Use uppercase names with underscores (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE) to represent constants that serve as <strong>unchanging configuration values</strong> in your program.<br>
        
          const <strong>INTEREST_RATE </strong>= 0.0525;<br>
          const <strong>COURSE_NUMBER</strong> = 'JS101';<br>
          const <strong>HOST</strong> = 'launchschool.com';<br>
          const <strong>FIRST_LETTER</strong> = 'a';              // magic number<br> 
          const <strong>LAST_LETTER </strong>= 'z';              
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants that represent so-called <strong>magic numbers</strong> (which may not actually be numbers) -- constants that are important to your program in some way but not as configuration values. For instance:<br>
       
      <span style="color: blue;">const</span> <strong>SECONDS_PER_MINUTE</strong> = 60;<br>
      <span style="color: blue;">const</span><strong> OUNCES_PER_POUND</strong> = 16;<br>
      <span style="color: blue;">const</span> <strong>METERS_PER_KILOMETER</strong> = 1000;<br>
      <span style="color: blue;">const</span> <strong>PI </strong>= 3.141528;<br>
      <span style="color: blue;">const </span><strong>INPUT_PROMPT</strong> = '==>';<br>
      <span style="color: blue;">const</span> <strong>TODAY</strong> = new Date();
    </p>
    <p>For all other constants, the rules are much more flexible. You may use <strong>camelCase, PascalCase, or even SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE</strong>. Use your personal preferences and any guidelines laid out by your teammates to choose your style.<br>
    
      <span style="color: blue;">const</span> <strong>greetings</strong> = `Hi! How are you today?`;<br>
      <span style="color: blue;">const</span> <strong>DeleteAllTodoLists</strong>  = "DELETE FROM todolists";<br>
      <span style="color: blue;">const</span>  <strong>FIND_TODOLIST</strong> = `SELECT * FROM todolists WHERE id = ${id}`;
    </p>
    <p><strong>All names -- variables and constants as well as functions</strong> -- should use the alphabetic and numeric characters only, though SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE names may use underscores as well. The first character must be alphabetic. Do not use consecutive underscores nor should you use names with underscores at the start or end of the name.</p>
    <h2>On Semicolons</h2>
    <p>Most JavaScript documentation, books, and articles show code that uses semicolons (;) to terminate most statements and expressions, resulting in code that looks like this:<br>

      let x = 3;<br>
      let y = 5;
    </p>
    <p>Most lines end with a semicolon; there are exceptions like blank lines and lines that end with { or }-curly braces and a few other situations.<br>
      A little-known fact is that JavaScript automatically, but invisibly, inserts semicolons where it needs them even if you ommit </p>
      <p>Some experienced developers take advantage of this mechanism and use (and promote) a no-semicolons-ever style. However, the style requires care: the insertion mechanism makes mistakes when it sees your code differently than you intended. That can be tricky to diagnose when it inserts a semicolon where you don't expect or want one. Thus, I discourage using the no-semicolons style in our script work.</p>
      <h2>Running JavaScript</h2>
      <p>Once you create a JavaScript file, one with a <strong>.js</strong> extension, you can run the code in that file by typing the <strong>node</strong> command followed by the file name.</p>
      <p>When you run a JavaScript file from the command line, the code gets executed by something called an <strong>interpreter</strong>. You don't need to know much about the interpreter right now except that it takes JavaScript code and turns it into code that your computer under</p>
      <p>The last tip is how to stop a running program. Sometimes, you'll have a long-running JavaScript program or an error in the logic that results in an infinite loop. To exit the program, use<strong>"control + c".</strong> This keystroke sends an abort signal to the running program.</p>
      <h2>Documentation</h2>
      <p>Reading documentation is an important habit to develop as you begin your programming journey. JavaScript, like all popular programming languages, comes with a large library of reusable code that you can use right away.<br>
        Nevertheless, you must read the documentation to learn how to use the features provided by that code. Without documentation, the only way for programmers to learn how to use these components is to read the source code directly.</p>
        <p>The official documentation of JavaScript standards can be found at ECMA International. The standards documentations are broken out by edition number. For instance, the 6th Edition refers to the 5th major version of the JavaScript standard published in 2015. It is listed as ECMAScript 2015, or, more commonly, ES6. Yes, the official name ends in 5, while the common name ends in 6. At the time of this writing (2020), the current version is the 10th edition, ECMAScript 2020, or ES11.</p>
