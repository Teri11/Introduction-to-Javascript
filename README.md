## Introduction to Javascript
This chapter takes a quick trip through a variety of different JavaScript topics.

<p><strong>JavaScript</strong> was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.

Apart from some superficial syntactic similarities, though, JavaScript is in no way related to the Java programming language.</p>
