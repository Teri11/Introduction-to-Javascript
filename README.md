## Introduction to Javascript
This chapter takes a quick trip through a variety of different JavaScript topics.

## A Brief JavaScript History
<p><strong>JavaScript</strong> was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator. Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript so they could position it as a companion for the Java language, a product of their partner, Sun Microsystems. Apart from some superficial syntactic similarities, though, JavaScript is in no way related to the Java programming language.</p>

## Who This Content is For.
<p>This book's intended audience is the inexperienced or brand-new programmer. If you apply the principles and techniques described here, you'll acquire a strong foundation on which to build your JavaScript programming career. You may use this knowledge to continue to learn more integrated concepts.

<p>Being a programmer is often perceived as difficult. It really isn't. It does, however, require a particular temperament: patience, persistence, focus, logic, detail-oriented, etc. When a programmer understands and adopts this temperament, their work becomes less frustrating, more fun, and rewardin</p>

## What's Not Covered
<p>While going through the contents of this topics, you may notice that it doesn't cover all the topics that other JavaScript sites cover. The omissions are intentional: JavaScript and programming are huge topics, and you'll benefit most from focusing on the fundamentals.My goal is to introduce you to programming. JavaScript, the language, happens to be the vehicle that we are using. As such, it covers the essential information you need to start your journey towards becoming a <strong>professional programmer</strong>.

## How to Read Through this topics
<p>Reading about programming and writing a program aren't the same. If you read this entire topics without ever writing a line of code, you may understand, intellectually, how to code, but you won't know how to do it. If someone asks you to solve a problem with a computer program, you won't be able to complete the task.
</p>
<p>There is a <strong>"muscle memory"</strong> aspect to programming that books and courses often overlook. With the vast amount of information that a programmer must remember, practicing some skills until they become automatic is unquestionably crucial. It doesn't require much effort; it happens naturally through repetition and practice. You can learn with your fingers, and, when you do, you free up your brain to focus on higher-level abstractions</p>
